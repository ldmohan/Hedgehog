Hedgehog: Detecting Drink Spiking on Wearables

We introduce "Hedgehog," a pervasive sensing approach that utilizes optical sensors in everyday wearables to identify spiked drinks. The technology analyzes variations in light reflectivity caused by small particles in the drink. We present a wearable prototype resembling a smart ring and report rigorous experiments demonstrating Hedgehog's effectiveness, with up to 89.71% accuracy in detecting tampered drinks. This innovation showcases the potential of wearables to provide a safety measure against a prevalent social issue.
